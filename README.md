# TinyDiffRast

Welcome to the TinyDiffRast project! 

Inspired by [tiny renderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki), this tiny course aims to explore, explain, and implement state-of-the-art approaches to _differentiable_ triangle rasterization.
The first objective of the course is to implement a rasterization-based _forward_ rendering pipeline.
After that we implement _inverse_ rendering techniques that allow us to learn 3D scene parameters (materials, lights, cameras, geometry) from 2D image supervision.

## The course content is best viewed on the [website](https://jjbannister.github.io/tinydiffrast/).
